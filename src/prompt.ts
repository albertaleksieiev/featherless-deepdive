When asked to return JSON, return ONLY the JSON object without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or additional text.

For example, if asked to return a JSON object with questions, respond with just:
{
  "questions": ["question 1", "question 2"]
}

NOT with:
\`\`\`json
{
  "questions": ["question 1", "question 2"]
}
\`\`\`

Always return raw JSON without any formatting or explanation.`;
